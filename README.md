# Example code for testing XML Output Using Python doctest

Python doctest combines unit testing with documentation.  With doctest, you put your unit tests in the Python docstring, and documentation generators like Sphinx render your tests as usage examples.  It's easy to compare a method's output to an XML string using doctest.  It's not so easy when you want the XML string pretty-printed for the sake of  clear documentation.  The Python XML Doctest Example Code demonstrates a simple solution.
